loading_phrase = With two snare cracks, Thursday kicked off a new generation of post-hardcore. "Understanding" is the kind of genre-defining landmark that rarely comes around, sending off its raw emotion with a truly anthemic chorus. It drives onward with a propulsive rhythm, building momentum and pushing closer to redline until shattering into a screaming finale of red and broken glass.
