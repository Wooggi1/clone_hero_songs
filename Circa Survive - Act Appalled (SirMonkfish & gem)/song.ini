loading_phrase = Act Appalled, originally appearing on the debut EP The Inuit Sessions, is the second song off Circa Survive's debut album, Juturna. Juturna is the Roman goddess of fountains, wells and springs and was used as the album title to symbolize a new beginning for the band's members. The band said in an interview that the album as a whole was inspired by the movie Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. While vocalist Anthony Green writes lyrics that are personal to him, he does leave them open to interpretation. One such interpretation ties in with the movie that the song is based on the scene where Kirsten Dunst and others were partying inside the room of Jim Carrey while his memories were being erased
