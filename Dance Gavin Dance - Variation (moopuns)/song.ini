loading_phrase = var·i·a·tion (noun) - a change or difference in condition, amount, or level, typically with certain limits; a different or distinct form or version of something. <br><br> The variation on display evolves within the song, going from a mindset of doubt to one of courage. This makes the first chorus a matter of guilt and doubt, and the second chorus a matter of accusation and consequence. With this in mind and with Jon and Tilian singing/shouting in tandem, this song has the best chorus ever made. I will <b>not</b> hear any dissenting opinions.
