loading_phrase = Giving the first taste of their long-awaited fourth album, Inertia, the thrilling charge of ‘Save The Cat’ is an unhinged industrial screamo anthem and a welcome return for Pendulum. It's been 15 years since Pendulum last delivered a full-length album, 2010's stadium-shaking Immersion. In the intervening years, the Australian drum & bass pioneers have dipped their toes back in the water with EPs and collaborative singles, but the promise of a new LP, Inertia, feels less like a calculated comeback and more like a reckless recalibration. And if ‘Save The Cat’ is any indication, the band, particularly frontman Rob Swire, has been through the wringer.
